# q_learning_project

## Implementation Plan

### Q-learning algorithm

* Executing the Q-learning algorithm
  * use formula given and translate it to code

* Determining when the Q-matrix has converged
  * 

* Determining robot actions
  *

### Robot perception

* Determining identities and locations of dumbbells
  * use the robot camera and LaserScan data (specifically for what's in front of it) to identify and move to the dumbbell

* Determining identities and locations of numbered blocks
  *


### RObot manipulation & movement

* Picking up and putting down dumbbells
  * Once the robot is at the correct dumbbell it should have open grippers with the gripper at the handle of the dumbbell. To pick up the dumbbell it should close the grippers and move the end effector upwards until the dumbell is off the ground

* Navigating to locations for pick up and put down of dumbbells
  * First I need to get the color dumbbell (robot_db) and block number (block_id) from q-learning algorithm. Then use the sensor data/functions from robot perception to navigate to the correct dumbbell and then block
  * I would test this by manually feeding the function(s) a dombbell color and block number and see if it behaves correctly
